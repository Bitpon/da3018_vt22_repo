# A story in DA3018

Once upon a time, by a lake called _Brunnsviken_, there was an old castle
made of red bricks. 

No one knows how old the castle was just like no one knows what the biggest ***prime number*** is...
Maybe it was just a coincidence and maybe it was not.Anyway...
A group of mathematicians gathered here in order to figure out what the biggest ***prime number*** is.
To find the biggest prime they first needed the biggest number. 
However, finding the biggest number proved to be a bigger task than expected.
To find the biggest number they needed the best and fastest counters in the whole world.

The mathematicians set out to hunt down the largest number. 
After a long and tiresome hunt they came to the agonizing realisation that there is no largest number. 
After successfully having gone through the five stages of grief they could finally move on to new exciting adventures.

The end :)
